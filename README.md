My jorney to the AI industry.

## Speach 

In 2017, I joined Facebook Speech team and working on the 
[smart speaker project Aloha](https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/08/smart-speaker-portal-facebook-amazon-alexa/).
It is my first step in the AI industry.

## Robot AI

In 2018, I joined Huawei to work on a robot project. I learn more about the Robot AI, 
it is more complex than smart speaker. Doctor Dylan Glas who was the lead architect 
for the ERICA is my project mentor.

## Computer Vision

2019, guide by Xin Yan for the Computer Vision.

## Dialog

2019, work with Doctor Rony Novianto on Samll Talk project.

## XAI

Recently we are facing a problem with explaining the model of AI, so here are few solutions.

1. LIME (local Interpretable Model-Agnotic Explanations)
2. RETAIN (Reverse Time Attention) model
3. LRP (layer-wise relevance propagation)

But XAI is still pretty new, I haven't find some real practice project for the theory yet.
