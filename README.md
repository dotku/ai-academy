### XAI

Recently we are facing a problem with explaining the model of AI, so here are few solutions.

1. LIME (local Interpretable Model-Agnotic Explanations)
2. RETAIN (Reverse Time Attention) model
3. LRP (layer-wise relevance propagation)

But XAI is still pretty new, I haven't find some real practice project for the theory yet.
